# 🧱 Cub3D

A simple 3D ray-casting engine written in **C** using **MLX42**.  
This project is inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D* and was built as part of the **42 School curriculum** to explore low-level graphics, math, and game engine design.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧭 **First-person 3D view** using ray-casting  
- 🗺️ **Map parsing** from `.cub` files  
- 🎨 **Textured walls and environments**  
- 🧍 **Player movement and rotation**  
- 🧱 **Collision detection**  
- 🌗 **Minimalistic graphics engine** built on **MLX42**  
- 🧩 **Custom libft** for utilities and memory management
